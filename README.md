# PatternPal

PatternPal is an intelligent task management app that learns from your behavior to predict and remind you of recurring tasks. By analyzing the patterns in your activities, PatternPal takes the mental load off remembering when to perform regular tasks, allowing you to focus on what's important.

## Features

- **Adaptive Learning**: PatternPal learns from your task completion patterns to provide personalized reminders.
- **Simple Task Entry**: Enter tasks with a verb and description (e.g., "got haircut").
- **Automatic Interval Tracking**: The app calculates average intervals between similar tasks.
- **Predictive Task Suggestions**: Receive suggestions for tasks you might need to do in the next 7 days.
- **One-Click Task Completion**: Mark tasks as done with a simple checkbox.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Task predictions improve over time as the app learns from your patterns.
